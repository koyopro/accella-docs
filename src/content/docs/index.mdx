import { Icon, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Installation

```bash
npm create accella@latest
```

## Features

<Card title="Server-First" icon="seti:csv">
  Accella follows the tradition of full-stack MVC frameworks. Based on Astro, it returns pre-rendered HTML to the client from the server. By keeping the architecture simple, it enhances both development efficiency and user experience.
</Card>
<Card title="ORM Integration" icon="seti:db">
  Accella utilizes Accel Record, an ORM implemented with the Active Record pattern. This integration enhances development efficiency, particularly for database CRUD operations.
</Card>
<Card title="Type Safety" icon="seti:tsconfig">
  Accella provides a type-safe development environment with TypeScript, covering everything from table operations to template rendering.
</Card>

## How to Achieve High Development Efficiency

- Full-Stack
  - Common tasks can be accomplished with minimal code by leveraging the framework's features, allowing you to focus on custom implementations.
  - Includes CRUD operations, validation, session management, password authentication, advanced search, form building, request parameter parsing, pagination, i18n, and security.
  - No need to spend time selecting libraries at the start of the project.
- Rapid feedback through type checking
  - TypeScript's type safety ensures high efficiency in debugging and refactoring.
  - In addition to database interactions, it offers type-safe template rendering using Astro components, which is unique compared to other server-side frameworks.
- Simple Architecture
  - Focuses on backend development, avoiding the need to develop server-side APIs and frontend applications separately like in SPAs.
  - No need to set up a separate server for SSR; keeps the infrastructure architecture simple.
- Integration with Frontend Frameworks
  - Returns pre-rendered HTML to the browser by default, but can flexibly integrate with frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) using Astro's features.

## Technologies

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
  - Forms the base of the framework, handling routing and rendering.
- [Accel Record](https://github.com/koyopro/accella/blob/main/packages/accel-record/README.md)
  - Advanced ORM adopting the Active Record pattern.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  - Handles table definitions and migrations.
