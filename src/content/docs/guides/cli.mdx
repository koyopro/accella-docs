title: Running Scripts with the CLI
---

You can easily execute scripts from the CLI using the `npx accel run` command. This command operates with an initialized database connection and leverages Vite internally, allowing you to pass TypeScript files directly.

If any of the following functions are defined in the script, they will be executed automatically:

- A function exported as `export default`
- A function exported as `main`

### Script File and Execution Example

```ts
// src/scripts/sample.ts
import { Account } from "./models/index.js";

export default async () => {
  const count = Account.count();
  console.log(`Total accounts: ${count}`);
};
```

```bash
$ npx accel run src/scripts/sample.ts
Total accounts: 10
```

### Custom CLI Commands

In addition to running scripts, you can also register custom CLI commands in the files under `src/commands/`. This allows you to execute custom processes with the database connection fully initialized.

#### Creating Custom Commands

```ts
// src/commands/hello.ts
import { program } from "accella/cli";
import { Account } from "../models";

program
  .command("hello")
  .description("Hello command")
  .action(() => {
    console.log("Hello from Accella!");
    const count = Account.count();
    console.log(`Total accounts: ${count}`);
  });
```

#### Running Custom Commands

```bash
# Run the command
$ npx accel hello
Hello from Accella!
Total accounts: 5
```
