description: How to add a new page and routing
---

You can use Astro's file-based routing.
To add a new page, create a new file in the `src/pages` directory.

## Example of Creating an Astro Page

When you initialize a project, `src/pages/index.astro` is provided.

For example, if you create `src/pages/about.astro`, you will be able to access it at http://localhost:4321/about when the development server is running.

```astro
// src/pages/about.astro
<p>This is the about page.</p>
```
