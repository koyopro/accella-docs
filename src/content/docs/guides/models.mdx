This page explains how to add models and use the corresponding classes.
In Accella, Prisma is used for table definitions and migrations, and Accel Record is used as the ORM.

## Steps to Add a Model

<Steps>

1. Edit the Schema

   The `db/schema/main.prisma` file is the schema file for models.
   Here, we will add a model. Below is an example of adding a User model.
   
   <Code code={`model User {
       id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
       firstName String
       lastName  String
       age       Int?
   }`} lang="prisma" title="db/schema/main.prisma" />

2. Run the Migration
   
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
   
   Running this command will:
   
   - Generate SQL migration files in the `db/migrations/` directory.
   - Create a new database and apply the SQL migrations.
   - Generate files corresponding to each model in the `src/models/` directory.

</Steps>

That's it! You've successfully added a model.

## Sample Table Operations

In the example above, a User class corresponding to the User model is generated.
Below is a sample TypeScript code for performing CRUD operations using the User class.

```typescript
import { User } from "src/models/index.js";

// Create a new user
const user: User = User.create({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
});

// Update the user
user.update({
  age: 26,
});

// Get all users
for (const user of User.all()) {
  console.log(user.firstName);
}

// Find a user
const john: User | undefined = User.findBy({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
});

// Delete the user
john.delete();
```

## Extending the Class Corresponding to a Model

In the example above, a class corresponding to the User model is generated in the `src/models/user.ts` file.
You can freely add methods to this class.

```typescript
// src/models/user.ts
import { ApplicationRecord } from "./applicationRecord.js";

export class UserModel extends ApplicationRecord {
  // Define a method to get the full name
  get fullName(): string {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

You can call the methods defined in the class as shown below.

```typescript
import { User } from "src/models/index.js";

const user = User.create({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
});

console.log(user.fullName); // => "John Doe"
```
