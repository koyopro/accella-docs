title: Flexible Search
---

Using the `Model.search()` method, you can perform object-based flexible searches.
(The interface is inspired by the [Ransack](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/) gem.)

Search parameters are specified as an object with keys representing the field name and search condition combination strings, and values representing the search values.
You can include associations in the keys.
The search conditions include `eq`, `cont`, `matches`, `lt`, `gte`, `in`, `null`, and more.
In addition, modifiers such as `not`, `or`, `and`, `any`, `all` are also available.
Please refer to the documentation of the `search()` method for more details.

```ts
import { User } from "./models/index.js";

const search = User.search({
  name_eq: "John", // name equals "John"
  age_not_null: 1, // age is not null
  profile_bio_cont: "foo", // related profile's bio contains "foo"
  email_or_name_cont_any: ["bar", "baz"], // email or name contains "bar" or "baz"
});
const users = search.result();
```

Additionally, you can include the names of searchable scopes defined in the `searchableScopes` array as keys in the search parameters.

For example, the `bio_cont` scope defined as follows can be used in the search parameters:

```ts
// src/models/user.ts

import { scope } from "accel-record";
import { ApplicationRecord } from "./applicationRecord.js";

class UserModel extends ApplicationRecord {
  @scope
  static bio_cont(value: string) {
    return this.joins("profile").where({
      profile: { bio: { contains: value } },
    });
  }
  static searchableScopes = ["bio_cont"];
}
```

```ts
import { User } from "./models/index.js";

const search = User.search({ bio_cont: "foo" }); // profile's bio contains "foo"
const users = search.result();
```
