Since Accella is based on Astro, you can use the same deployment methods as Astro.

## Deploying to Various Hosting Services

For instructions on deploying to hosting services like Netlify or Vercel, please refer to [Deploy your Astro Site](https://docs.astro.build/guides/deploy/) (Astro Docs).
Note that Accella requires `SSR` support to function properly. It will not work with `Static` hosting.

## Deploying with Docker Containers

For deployment using containers, refer to [Build your Astro site with Docker](https://docs.astro.build/recipes/docker/) (Astro Docs).
Use this method if you want to run it on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or other similar services.
