import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When you create a project with `create accella`, the following directory structure is generated.

Accella generally follows the Astro project structure but adds directories like `db/` for database-related files and `src/models/` for files related to Accel Record.

## Overview of Project Structure

Inside your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

<FileTree>

- db/
   - schema/
      - main.prisma
- src/
   - config/
      - session.ts
      - initializers/
         - database.ts
   - models/
      - index.ts
   - pages/
      - index.astro
- public/
- package.json

</FileTree>

### `db/`

This directory contains database-related files.
`db/schema/main.prisma` is the Prisma schema file where you can define your database models.
When you define models, migration files are generated in `db/migrations/`.

### `src/config/`

The `src/config/` directory contains configuration files.
`session.ts` is used to configure session management, and the `initializers/` directory contains files that run when the server starts.

### `src/models/`

Files related to Accel Record, generated based on the schema file, are stored in `src/models/`.

### `src/pages/`

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

### `public/`

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
